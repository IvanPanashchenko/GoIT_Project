# GoIT_Project
This project was performed by Ostap Komar and Ivan Panashchenko
The main concept of the project was to create your own Address book using Python.  Interaction with Addressbook was performed by command line interaction(Or CLI). We needed to write the code with the next function tools: Add contact, View contacts, make search thru contacts. But the real challenge was to save contacts and view them after the next program opening. So we are pleased to present you this CLI project. It's free to copy and you can change it whenever you like. Enjoy!
